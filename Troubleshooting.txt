--- FATAL ERROR at startup ---
0. Make sure you have proper administrator privileges to run the game.
1. Add a circumvention to your firewall/antivirus and restart the game
2. If it still crashes, make sure that your antivirus did not REMOVE any essential files. Sometimes
  the exe or some .dll files are quarantined. Check the Quarantine/Virus vault or re-download
  the game, and launch it again while the antivirus is disabled or the circumvention is active.
3. Update your DRIVERS. Many crashes have so far been fixed with a simple Video card driver update,
   especially AMD cards. You might have to force an optiona/experimental download to see the latest driver.
4. Still crashing? Go to https://trello.com/c/I6FQo76V/61-download-links and try the Compatibility check.
   If that crashes, your computer has an issue with running the engine.
5. If you are still crashing, you can go to the Discord and ask for help in #troubleshooting, but please
   be aware that if you crash on startup, the issue has to do with your computer, not the game. Go into the 
   /ManicMiners/Saved/Crash folder and get the .dump file as well as the .log file. The dump file will tell
   you exactly what type of error caused the crash when loaded into Microsoft Visual Studio.


--- Settings are stuck in a way so I can't run the game! ---
Delete the folder /Saved in /ManicMiners


--- My controls are frozen! ---
Please report this as a bug and include what menu you were clicking or navigating when it happened.


--- I found a bug! ---
0. Before reporting, can you reproduce it or not? That is, make it happen again with a specific list of actions. 
   An image and a description of how to make it happen is usually essential for me to fix it. At other times, I 
   can figure out what's wrong only by reading your problem description, but images are very good.
1. Check the Trello here if you can find it: https://trello.com/c/ZvVkGxEc/33-bugs-improvements-todo-suggestions
2. Go to my Discord ( https://discord.gg/8Z7bgv8 ) and check if the bug has been recently reported in #feedbackandbugs. 
3. If the bug is not there at first glance, report it with as much info as possible such as what speed the game was 
playing on, what relevant settings you used, what map it occured on and how to reproduce it. 

If the issue only happens ONCE and never again, it might not be worth reporting, but report as you please.

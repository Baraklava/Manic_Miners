### Author's note 2020-04-09: I've abandoned GitHub as a distribution platform. It might return if Manic Miners eventually goes open-source. For now, you can download the game on itch.io: https://baraklava.itch.io/manic-miners

# Manic Miners: The Rock Raiders remake
Manic Miners is an in-progress complete Lego Rock Raiders remake done in Unreal Engine. Play it for free right here, right now!

**If you have played the original Rock Raiders game and just want to jump right in without reading the project backstory and explanations, here are some quick notes:**

- The game is programmed by one person, Baraklava. Please respect that implementations, however easy they are to implement, might take time.

- There are two types of builds: "Major update builds", where all bugs should be fixed, and "Experimental builds" which will probably have bugs as they are largely untested. This page is for *Experimental builds*. For the major update builds, see these links: https://trello.com/c/I6FQo76V/61-download-links . To report bugs in this build, [join my Discord](https://discord.gg/85k8JHz)!


- The game is far from feature complete. You will be missing stuff like vehicles and monsters, but the miners are very functional, as well as building construction. It indubitably has some bugs, but not more than the original, and at this point I need your help to find them!

- The game runs in debug mode. You might get some messages that doesn't make sense, which either means I've forgot to remove them or they indicate something is wrong.

- Some older hardware can not run the game at all. I need a larger sample size to figure out why that is. Case on point: Intel HD Graphics.

- Resources have physics. They'll roll. If they roll into lava or water, they are gone. Take care where you put your buildings!

- Clicking a wall doesn't colour it immediately. They'll have a "token" showing you commanded a drilling etc there. They'll turn coloured *when a miner is approaching the wall*. 

- Resources are dispensed on demand, not when you order a building.

- The AI is still in its infancy: You will find hundreds of ways the AI can be improved to make smarter decisions, many of which I'm aware but just haven't had time to implement. 1) This will grow over time, 2) Don't treat it too much like an idle game, you can command them to do stuff yourself, you know! 


That's it, you are now ready to jump into the game!

**Now, for a more elaborate FAQ:**

*What is this?*

Manic Miners is a rebuild of the 1999 game Lego Rock Raiders. It has been in development since late May 2019 and is programmed by a single person; Baraklava.

*Is this game sponsored by The Lego Group?*

This game has nothing to do with The Lego Group, although I definitely wish I worked for them! 

*Why are you doing this project?* 

Rock Raiders is one of my favourite Lego themes, from a time when Lego was a company of experimentation and fearlessness. While those times were monetarily harsh for Lego, they have left an impression that I want to carry on by remaking this game and hopefully keep the memory of this franchise alive. During college, I discovered a love for programming, and my love for Lego was also rekindled. After making the discovery that, to this day, no one has made a worthy Rock Raiders successor/replacement, I decided to make an assessment of it is was viable for a single person. 

There I saw an opportunity: All the assets were available, taunting me. It's also proving a golden opportunity to prove myself that I *can* finish a huge project all on my own, a good engineering skill... And here we are!

*Is the game going to cost anything?*

In the spirit of the Lego community, and considering how niche this game is, I will keep the game free for everyone. As long as there are assets in the game I don't own, monetizing it is lawful suicide anyway. When the game gets completely done, I might consider remaking the "borrowed" assets and launch commercially on consoles and other places, but the PC version containing Rock Raiders assets will always be free.

*Is the game done? Why are you revealing it now?*

No, the game is not done and will keep getting updates as I add more features. This, however, will take time, as I'm also doing my studies at the same time, and they have higher priority. I'm revealing this because I think other people might be interested in seeing development, helping with design decisions and create a community around a Rock Raiders game reborn. 

*I see you have not made a game before. There's been at least few dozen remake attempts. What makes you think you can complete this project on your own?*

I work hard, I program well, and my pipelines for the project are insanely efficient. Rather than being a Lego fan driven by will alone, I have a really solid engineering and programming basis to stand on, as well as the simplest programming IDE you can imagine. No one has gotten as far as I have gotten, but no one has also had the same premise I have. I aim to keep programming in my spare time until it is done.

And while it's true I haven't made any games before, I've been programming quite a lot. Unreal Engine is incredibly intuitive in addition to the quick programming pipeline it provides, and I've had little to no troubles making the game work, as it mostly comes down to maths anyway.

*Is the game open source?*

The game is not Open Source. But there will be modding support, and if there are specific parts you want me to make moddable, you can input a request in the Discord server (link below)

*How can I contribute to the project?*

As I've mentioned, I am the only programmer, and am therefore not looking for programming help. I am however definitely open to other collaborations! If you make assets that you want to contribute to the game, such as music, art, models or other fun stuff that fits the spirit of the Lego Rock Raiders game or era, you can share it in my Discord #submissions channel. Anything you put there should be owned by you and published under a Creative Commons license stating anyone can use it for free if giving credit. However, just because you submit it doesn't mean it will get added: I place the final verdict on every feature.

*What about donations and Patreon?*

I'm not looking for any monetary returns, I don't need the money, I do this because it's rewarding in other ways. Refusing donations also allow me to work at my own pace. If you want to contribute anything that isn't money in order to help my work on the project (such as software) then send me a PM.

*Will feature XXX be added?*

Check the Trello pages to the right and the user suggestions below. The game will firsthand stay true to the original (apart form any obvious immediate improvements). Along the way, stuff will of course be added, but I'm aiming to have settings and modes to make both purists and newcomers happy. There's gotta be so much more this game can offer. 

There is one grand exception: Bugs. Any behaviour that is considered "unintended" will not be in development focus. This includes walking on walls and running "in between" wall, as that is unpredictable and ruins level design. If I find a way to reproduce it easily, however, I aim to add such quirks as a "legacy bug" option.

If you have any suggestions that are not here, but would fit the game, feel free to put them in #suggested-additions in my Discord

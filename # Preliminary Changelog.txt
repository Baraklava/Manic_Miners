General:
- Added quick hotkeys!
	- Q: Quick key. If a wall is clicked, mark it for drilling. If rubble, mark it for shoveling. If ground, command a Power Path there
	- E: Explode/Electric. If a wall is clicked, send a Dynamite there. If any floor tile, it will order an Electric Fence to be placed there (in the future builds)
	- R: Reinforce. Will be implemented when Reinforcing becomes a thing.
- Enabled priorities! They should work completely and you can toggle them on and off. Let me know if you encounter issues
	- Note: They will still always shovel rubble first if they stand on it. This will possibly change.

Buildings:
- Added 6 new buildings!
	- Docks: Place it by water and it will...flex?
	- Upgrade Station: Will do fancy animations for now
	- Ore Refinery: If you have this, miners will carry their ore there and make Studs!
	- Geological Center: Does nothing. Only uses 1 "Base tile" now (Thanks Batman for the suggestion!)
	- Mining Laser: Standing there, menancingly
	- Super Teleport: Not much action yet
- Added Idle and Action animations to buildings
- Added "Animation test" button to Right Ctrl, use it to see a cool animation!
- Added Power Paths System: It is very complex under the hood, so let me know if you encounter any issues.
- Enabled Power On/Off buttons
- Added building requirement holograms
- Added Miner teleport effects


Miners/AI:
- Made rotation smooth instead of instant.
- Tasks are now only accepted if miners can reach them
- Picking up stuff is only automatic if they can reach a dropoff point. (They need the barriers to build anyway)
- Navigation and task system completely overhauled
- Selecting a miner now orients them towards your camera
- Animation: Teleport
- Animation: Teleport up

Resources:
- Random rotation of resource when spawning from walls
- Dynamite now gets "recycled" if destroyed instead of simply forgotten
- Dynamite now gives off a screen shake
- Dynamite now only spawns reachable positions (contrary to drilling that can be queued wherever)
- Dynamite doesn't roll away from walls anymore
- Dynamite marker now properly stays until the wall is blasted

World:
- Rolling rocks and dust effects when drilling a wall

Interface:
- Added temporary options panel, but buttons are disabled so far.

Materials:
- All brick pieces now have a slightly matte surface to look more realistic.

Level Editor:
- Expanded Resource cheat panel to work with individual resources
- Added "Resource Drain" to set all resources to zero

Data handling:
- Updated building's Power Paths to be specified by Integers, not Vectors. If you encounter issues with Building Power Paths when loading a map you've done previously, let me know.


Details:
- Changed Support Station's air vents to air intakes, as they should be
- Added effects to the Teleport Pad
- Building sounds are now only active when the building is powered

Bugfixes:
- Fixed some arrow pointers getting left behind when clicking miners/buildings
- Fixed Buildings menu hotkey not resetting Player State


Notes and bugs:
- Mining Laser is placable without being next to a Power Path
- Dispensing crystals does not power down buildings (will integrate a "power lock" into the priorities so that crystals can steal power from some buildings, but not others)
- Teleporting miners can go over the limit if you spam
- Power paths are forced to "quick update" right now, but will have an option for slow mode in the real update (from the demo I showed you last week)
- Buildings still have no collisions nor foundations. The Teleport Pad will look like it teleports miners at the wrong height.

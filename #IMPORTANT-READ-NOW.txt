1. If the game crashes with a FATAL ERROR on startup, 
   your antivirus is blocking it. Add an exception or hope
   that it realises the game is safe and try again.

2. GitHub ruins the level data files. You therefore have to:
	- Unzip Levels.zip
	- Place all of the contents in /ManicMiners/Levels

3. That's it, you're good to go!

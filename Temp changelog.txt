Changes since last build:

New features:
- Added "Mangle terrain" in level editor. It randomizes a height offset up or down BUT it is a bit broken right now and will 
 leave holes in the terrain where chunks intersect. When saved, it will load 100% fine next time though. 
- Training, tools, vehicle upgrades are now instant in the Level Editor if "Free stuff" is enabled.
	- As a reminder: Miners riding in vehicles are saved. They can be "re-activated" by loading through "Simulate Real Level"
- Level editor now has "Free stuff" as a global toggle rather than "Free buildings" only.
- Buildings menu + air meter + Miner count now gives better feedback of air production. Teleporting down an oxygen-producing now also gives an air boost in the beginning
- Added link to Map forum on the Custom Level popup

Vehicles:
- Vehicles now auto-turn a bit quicker by default. This will make them navigate tighter curves at higher speeds
 but not look as "authentic". Let me know if it gives you any issues.
- Vehicles now get pushed away from walls slightly
- In tight spaces, vehicles now turn much quicker
- Chrome Crusher and Granite Grinder has gotten slight drill buffs to be roughly equal to the LMLC
- LMLC had its cooldown increased from 2 to 3 seconds by default. It's still very powerful, and mining a bit quicker than the ChCr.
- Vehicles can now recharge crystals
- Water vehicles now drop off their resources at the Docks if no other dropoff is found 

Level Editor: 
- Added vehicles menu to the Level Editor

Fixes:
- Fixed border sometimes not lining up with the map
- Fixed some model clipping issues
- Fixed vehicles "vibrating"
- Softened cursor point light

Reported bugs:
- Ore and studs can sometimes randomly be seen floating high above the base
- Tunnel Transport can't build stuff properly
- Vehicles slowly "slide" when idle (for 2 seconds at least)
- Multi-select is notoriously wide for vehicles under certain circumstances. This is an issue with the engine function that I
	can not meddle with. Will look for a workaround.
